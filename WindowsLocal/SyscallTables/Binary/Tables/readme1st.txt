sstComposer (sstc.exe) expect directory Tables (with all subdirs) in the process current directory. So before running it, copy Tables folder to the same folder where sstc.exe located.

e.g.

If sstc.exe is in C:\sgen directory, then move Tables (including all subdirs) to the C:\sgen, resulting in C:\sgen\Tables.
